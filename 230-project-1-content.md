## High Concept
Set of randomized dungeons with deckbuilding and turn based combat, with creatures both as attackers and life points.

## Platform and Genre
A Card/Roguelike RPG for the desktop

## Aesthetics
Semi-Cartoonish art with ambient music

## Story
Method: No dialogue so only visual story telling with possible optional writings as unlockables (stretch goal).

Content: Beginning in a cavern of a fantastical world you travel the whole land attempting to escape this land in which you don't belong by reaching and end of the contentinent that you find yourself on. There are all different types of places to go around from mountains to desert to frozen tundra with all of the elemental forces there is a lot of variation in areas.

## Gameplay
Mechanics: Procedural choices for new cards and creatures, procedural levels, permadeath, deckbuilding and turn based combat.

Controls: Keyboard when out of combat, and Mouse when in combat

Teaching: No actual tutorial section, but difficulty of enemies starts lower and options are laid out.

Learning: Card choice for the deck and for the turn, along with creature choice as well.

## Other 
This project is far too large and I really should not be taking this on.
